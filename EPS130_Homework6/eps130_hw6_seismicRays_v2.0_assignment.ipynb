    "# Seismic Rays\n",
    "We can use Snell's Law and simple geometry to calculate the path of a ray through a layered earth model, from source to receiver. One approach is to \"shoot\" rays of one type (direct, multiple, etc.) from the source at different angles and see where they end up reaching the surface. We could guess and check angles manually until we find the right distance to the reciever. The computer does the ray-shooting calculation fast enough that we might as well calculate the distance for a range of angles all at once, then select the angle with the closest result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the takeoff angle we can calculate the horizontal slowness $p$ of the ray. Then we can also determine the traveltime and solve for the wave amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply the method to study observations of the 1988 Upland earthquakes reported in Dreger and Helmberger (1990). The Dreger and Helmberger (1990) paper is available to read (dreger_1.pdf) in this directory. In this paper two small earthquakes, located 44 km from the Pasadena broadband stations were studied, modeling the complete seismograms to constrain the Earth structure and better learn what is possible in terms of waveform modeling using the new (at the time) very broadband, high dynamic range seismic instrumentation. The figure below shows the location of the earthquakes and the Pasadena seismic station. In this exercise you will 1) make measurements of differential times between direct S and the first multiple S, 2) measure the relative amplitudes of the phases, and compare the results with a prescribed velocity model assigning a depth for each of the earthquakes. Then you will perturb the velocity model (layer velocity and thickness) to see if better agreement is possible.\n",
