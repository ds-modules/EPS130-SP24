    "\n",
    "The indicator equation describes the response of a single degree of freedom oscillator that is weakly coupled to the ground through a spring suspension system and mechanical damping system. Under certain conditions dictated by the parameters of the indicator equation related to the design of the instrument the mass remains fixed in space in an absolute, inertial reference frame as the ground moves beneath it. Understanding the response of this system is important to seismologists in that the desired information is not the relative motion of the instrument with respect to its internal reference frame, but the actual motion of the ground on which the instrument is resting. It is possible using filter theory to remove the response of the instrument."

Remember you want to use a critially damped instrument (although it might be intesting to examine different amounts of damping on the solution). The output will will the same length array as the frequency array."

    "Modern broadband and high dynamic range instruments use electronic feedback to maintain mass position thereby increasing dramatically the linearity of the response and through electronic control the band width of the response. Whereas it once required two or more stations on a single pier to obtain records spanning the observational range of earthquake phenomena now only one of these modern force-feed back instruments is needed. In Figure 1 the Fourier Amplitude Spectrum of the transverse component record from Parkfield for the October 31, 2007 Alum Rock Mw5.4 earthquake is compared to a spectrum of pre-event noise. Figure 2 compares the broadband ground displacement with several historic instruments such as the short- and long-period Wood-Andersons, the Galitzen, and the Press-Ewing. These instruments are obviously tuned to be sensitive to different frequency (period) passbands.\n",

For the Love and Rayleigh waves they tend to be longer period on the order of 5 to 10+ seconds. Give a brief justification or explanation for the picks that you have made. Is any particular instrument more suitable for making the body wave (P and S) identifications? What about for the surface wave identification?"
