    "# Homework1: Earthquake Occurrence Statistics - Gutenberg-Richter\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics of earthquake occurrence is revealed from catalogs of seismicity, which include event time, location and magnitude. We will talk about how earthquakes are located and how magnitudes are estimated separately, but for now it is sufficient to know that this information can be easily acquired. With such catalogs it is possible to compare the seismic activity of different regions, make informed assessments about the frequency of earthquake occurrence, and learn about the fault rupture process. Maps of the earthquakes in catalogs over time reveal the structure of faulting in a region, and provide a framework with which to study the seismotectonics of a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary earthquake statistics used by seismologists. They are the Gutenberg-Richter relationship (Gutenberg and Richter, 1949), and the Omori Law (Omori, 1894). \n",
    "\n",
    "Gutenberg and Richter found that when the logarithm of the number of earthquakes is plotted vs. magnitude that the distribution (data) may be described by linear model, log(N)=A+Bm, where N is the number of earthquakes equal to or larger than m, m is the magnitude and A (y-intercept) and B (slope) are refered to as the Gutenberg-Richter statistics or coefficients. They found that on a global scale, and subsequently more generally, the B-value or the slope of the Gutenberg-Richter line is approximately equal to -1. Thus for each increase in earthquake magnitude there are approximately 10 times fewer earthquakes. If, for example, there are 100 M3 events in a region per year, then the Gutenberg-Richter relationship generally finds that there would be approximately 10 M4 events and 1 M5 event in each year. For magnitudes larger than M5 there would be fewer than one event per year. Gutenberg-Richter is a very important earthquake statistic because it is used to determine the rates of earthquake occurrence, which is a key step in characterizing earthquake hazards (we will see this in future homework exercises). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Omori Law is used to characterize the rate at which aftershocks occur following a large mainshock event. This statistic is used for comparing the aftershock productivity of different earthquakes and regions, make forecasts of the likelihood of large damaging aftershocks and to distinguish between earthquake faulting and possibly geothermal or volcanic-related seismicity by examining whether the distribution describes a \"mainshock/aftershock\" pattern or is more \"swarm-like\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will use python code in this notebook to investigate the Gutenberg-Richter for the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as develop numerical analysis skills using python. In the next assignment you will investigate the Omori statistics for the Loma Prieta Earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is not a python class, but the primary programming tool that we will be used is python. However, if you know MatLab or have other programing background and would prefer to use it, you are free to use those tools instead."

The results for the Gutenberg-Richter statistics were generally pretty good, however a correct implementation of Gutenberg-Richter considers only the primary events. Therefore, we seek a catalog with aftershocks removed in order to improve our assessment of the Gutenberg-Richter statistics. The process to remove aftershocks is called declustering.\n",

    "## Declustering Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis that was just performed was for the raw catalog, which means that it includes all events. However Gutenberg-Richter is really interested in the occurrence of primary \"main shock\" events, and therefore it is necessary to decluster the catalog to obtain an unbiased estimate of the G-N coefficients. Declustering here means remove the aftershocks from the catalog. This is done using an algorithm that relates the \"expected\" time and distance range of aftershocks from a given mainshock. Large mainshocks will result in aftershock populations that, statistically speaking, have a greater likelihood to occur over longer time periods and greater mainshock-aftershock distances compared with smaller mainshock-aftershock series. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code block below defines a declustering algorithm. This algorithm uses distance and time metrics that are magnitude dependent, called 'Dtest' and 'Ttest'. If a given event falls within the maximal values defined by Dtest and Ttest for its magnitude it is deemed an aftershock and removed from the catalog. After all events are processed, the remaining catalog is then comprised of only primary events. This declustered catalog can be used to estimate more accurate Gutenberg-Richter statistics. Furthermore, we can study the aftershock events that the algorithm removed for a given earthquake in the context of the Omori Law statistics (Exercise 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because aftershock identification is an empirical procedure, there are many different ways to define the Dtest and Ttest relationships. Stiphout et al., (2012, on page 10) summarizes three different definitions of the Dtest/Ttest relationships originally proposed by Uhrhammer (1986), Knopoff and Gardner (1972). The following are the equations in Stiphout et al. (2012) are for method 1 in the declustering function defined below.\n",
    "<img src=\"./Figures/window_approx.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the event reduction rate (final number divided by the initial number of events) for the three different proposed distance and time windows. You can do this by adding a logical (if statement) tree to enable switching between different definitions of Dtest and Ttest in declustering_algorithm below. The first definition (Eqn 1 from Stiphout et al., 2012, p.10) has already been completed. Note that some of these algorithms will not run instantaneously and might take up to a few minutes."
